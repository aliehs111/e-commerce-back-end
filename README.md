 ## Installation
 Be sure to be running Node.js on your machine.  This repo can be cloned, when the file is opened in a code editor, open an integrated terminal, use mysql to create the schema (type source db/schema.sql). Then exit mysql and use the CLI to seed the database (npm run seed).  The npm start.  Use Insomnia to test the functions.  If you will be modifying code, then use npm watch rather than npm start so you don't have to stop/start the terminal.
 ## Usage
 To application requires all four CRUD operations; CREATE (POST http request), READ (GET http request), UPDATE (PUT http request) and DELETE (DELETE http request).  So it would be a good resource for a student to evaluate to learn more about CRUD operations and how they are hanled as http requests.
 ## Tests
 Use Insomnia to test the code.  Use localhost:3001 or change the code to your preferred url.
